# SearchFoldersForJsonFiles
A simple json search for a file inside a folder or subfolder that contains the wildcard pattern.

Can be used freely in any project! Don't need to credit me.

In regards to it's use, there is some use cases inside the Program.Main method, will read only Json and convert it to your specified Json object!

The only cavetas is that your Json file must be a Json Array, for the object to be pooled together.
